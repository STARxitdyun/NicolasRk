# CKSDev for Visual Studio
## Community kit for SharePoint Development

This repository is an updated CKSDev (Community Kit for SharePoint Development) toolkit originally developed by Wes Hackett (https://github.com/weshackett).

### Why ?

Because even if this toolkit is not maintained anymore, it is still useful for SharePoint on-premise developpment.
The last official version is for Visual Studio 2012. A lot of unofficial version are on the web but i wasn't able to find a version compatible with Visual Studio 2019.

### How ?

I took the 2013 sources and updated it to make it work with Visual Studio 2019. All tests have been made on Visual Studio 2019 Community and Enterprise Edition.
However, this version should work with Visual Studio 2017 too (and maybe 2015).

### Compatibility

This version is compatible with following versions:

Version | Compatibility
------------ | -------------
Visual Studio 2017 | :interrobang:
Visual Studio 2019 | :heavy_check_mark:

### Minimum Framework

Required framework is .Net Framework 4.6

# CKSDev for Visual Studio
## Community kit for SharePoint Development

This repository is an updated CKSDev (Community Kit for SharePoint Development) toolkit originally developed by Wes Hackett (https://github.com/weshackett).

### Why ?

Because even if this toolkit is not maintained anymore, it is still useful for SharePoint on-premise developpment.
The last official version is for Visual Studio 2012. A lot of unofficial version are on the web but i wasn't able to find a version compatible with Visual Studio 2019.

### How ?

I took the 2013 sources and updated it to make it work with Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2017.
